HTML Email with Swift Mailer

To send HTML email with Swift Mailer, simply pass the
HTML markup to the setBody() method of the message object,
and set the second argument to 'text/html'.

As the Swift Mailer documentation explains
(http://swiftmailer.org/docs/messages.html#setting-the-body-content),
you should always add a plain text version of the content
using the addPart() method.
